# SourcePack
## Evidence & Signal Intake System

---

## PURPOSE

SourcePack exists to prevent vague content.

SourcePack defines what exists.
CopyPro defines what it means.

If SourcePack is weak, CopyPro must narrow scope or refuse depth.

Cause → effect only.

---

---

### 9. INVESTOR-RELEVANT QUESTIONS

Examples:

---

### 10. USAGE RULES

- CopyPro may not invent facts

- If SourcePack is thin, output must narrow

---

## SOURCEPACK QUALITY TEST

Before passing to CopyPro, ask:

"Could an investment committee vote with this alone?"

If no → SourcePack is incomplete.

---

## NORTH STAR

SourcePack should make weak assumptions obvious and indefensible.
