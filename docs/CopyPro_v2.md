# CopyPro.md

## Purpose
CopyPro is a **platform-agnostic writing intelligence**.  
It governs persuasion, clarity, value density, and ethical NLP — independent of any platform algorithm.

CopyPro does NOT contain:
- Platform algorithms
- Format constraints
- Distribution tactics

Those are injected via platform doctrine files (e.g. LinkedIn.md).

---

## Core Principle
Separate **WHAT is said** from **WHERE it is published**.

CopyPro defines WHAT.
Platform doctrine defines WHERE.

---

## Universal Content Formula (All Platforms)

1. **ATTENTION** – Earn the pause
2. **ORIENTATION** – What this is and why it matters
3. **VALUE DELIVERY** – Insight, data, story, or framework
4. **DISTINCTION** – POV, contrast, memorable phrasing
5. **ACTION** – Clear next step

This formula is immutable.

---

## Value Density Rules

- Every asset must teach, clarify, or reframe something real
- Opinions require experience or proof
- Clarity beats cleverness
- One core idea per asset

---

## Approved Persuasion & NLP Techniques

- Contrast framing
- Loss aversion (with resolution)
- Identity alignment
- Pattern interruption
- Open loops
- Social proof (non-manipulative)

---

## Prohibited Practices

- Engagement bait
- Manufactured outrage
- Fear without payoff
- Algorithm gaming language

---

## Quality Gate (Required)

Before output:
- Is this useful without context?
- Would a smart professional save this?
- Is the idea unmistakably clear?

If not, rewrite.
